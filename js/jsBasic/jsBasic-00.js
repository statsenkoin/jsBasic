/* ----- Declare JavaScript Variables -----------------------------------------
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. 
JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, 
boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, 
and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections 
of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, 
but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the 
data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, 
which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. 
Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can 
store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting 
the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements 
with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, 
and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.

Hint
Look at the ourName example above if you get stuck.
 */

// var myName;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* ----- Storing Values with the Assignment Operator --------------------------
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with 
the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are 
performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left 
of the operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 
to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program 
will treat it as if it is 5.

Assign the value 7 to variable a.
*/

// Setup
var a;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* ----- Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another -----------------------
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, 
you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using 
the assignment operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;

The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. 
Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of 
myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has 
the value of 5.

Assign the contents of a to variable b.
 */
// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

// Only change code below this line
b = a;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* ----- Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator ------------------
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line 
as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.
 */
var a = 9;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* ----- Declare String Variables ---------------------------------------------
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is 
a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them 
the values of your first and last name, respectively.
 */
var myFirstName = 'Ihor';
var myLastName = 'Statsenko';

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* ----- Understanding Uninitialized Variables --------------------------------
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of 
undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your 
result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string 
with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.

Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" 
respectively so that they will not be undefined.
